## Projects
### Langchain Text to SQL Inventory Q&A System (Generative AI) 

- Integrated **Langchain** and **Hugging Face** models to build a natural language interface that simplifies **SQL** interactions for non-technical users. This approach made querying more accessible and also **optimized query performance**, significantly improving user experience and efficiency.
- Designed a scalable T-shirt inventory system with **dynamic SQL queries** and seamless user interactions, focusing on efficiency and robustness.
- Built reusable SQL queries to enhance **data retrieval** speed and **accuracy**, ensuring application stability with thorough testing and debugging.

### Personalized Cancer Diagnosis (Predictive AI) 

- Analyzed and classified genetic variations into nine distinct classes based on evidence from clinical literature, ensuring accurate categorization.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to clean the data, identify statistical patterns, detect anomalies, and assess feature distributions. 
- Applied One-Hot encoding and Response Encoding for categorical features based on their significant relationship with the target variable. 
- Trained and evaluated multiple models including Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, and Stacked Models.

## Academic Projects
### Econometrics (_Jan 2024 – May 2024_) 

- Tested the impact of Special Economic Zones on capital formation, invested capital and export revenue to assess their economic contribution. 
- Implemented two logistic regression models with dummy variables using STATA to evaluate the impact of SEZs in economic outcomes. 
- Concluded that SEZs contribute to boosting export revenue for the country and have the positive relationship between SEZ status and GCF. 

### Programming Lab (_Jul 2023 – Dec 2023_)
-  Visualized the increase in atmospheric CO2 levels and estimated the rate of CO2 change over time to highlight environmental trends.
-  Analyzed the rise of verified COVID-19 cases using data from JHU-CSSE, creating a time series to track global confirmed cases.
-  Created a choropleth map visualizing global COVID-19 cases, showcasing the pandemic's spread across different countries.
